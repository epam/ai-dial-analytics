# ADAS 0.24 — upgrade notes

What an environment has to do to move from **0.23** to **0.24**. An environment on an earlier build first
follows [`release-0.23-upgrade.md`](release-0.23-upgrade.md).

Three things make this release more than a redeploy:

- a **coordinated deploy** with the Enrichment Runner, because the contract version rises from `4` to `5`; a
  runner on the other version is refused, so enrichment pauses until both sides match
  ([Enrichment pipelines calling a DIAL application route](#enrichment-pipelines-calling-a-dial-application-route));
- a **breaking response shape**: a chart's `y_field` is now an array, so a client that reads it as a string must
  move to the array ([Multi-series charts](#multi-series-charts));
- a **wider meaning of `*`** in read-side grant lists and row policies, which now stands for every authenticated
  caller, so look for a stored `*` before upgrading ([The `*` grantee](#the--grantee)).

## Multi-series charts

A chart's `y_field` — on a saved query and on a dashboard widget's `inline_query` — is now an array of result
columns, one per series (see [`saved-queries`](../openspec/specs/saved-queries/spec.md)). Responses always carry the
array, so a client that reads `y_field` as a string must move to the array; a one-element array is the old
single-series chart. Requests may still send a string, and charts stored before the upgrade are returned as a
one-element array without a migration.

- **Rollback.** A build older than 0.24 cannot read a chart stored as an array: reading that saved query, the
  scope list it appears in, its revision snapshot, or a dashboard holding such a widget fails. Before rolling back,
  rewrite each stored `y_field` array to its first element in `saved_query.chart`, `saved_query_aud.chart` and
  `dashboard.widgets` (the nested `inline_query.chart`).

## The `*` grantee

`*` in a table's `get`, `read` or `sensitive` grant list, or as the role of a row policy, now stands for every
authenticated caller (see [`row-level-security.md`](row-level-security.md)). Earlier builds stored `*` as an
ordinary role name that matched only a caller carrying a provider role spelled `*`.

- **Before upgrading, look for a stored `*`.** A table that already names `*` in a read-side list becomes readable
  by every authenticated caller, with its sensitive columns when the list is `sensitive`. Remove the entry
  (`PUT /v1/tables/{name}/access`) unless that is what you want. After the upgrade, the startup log lists every
  table that names `*` and where.
- A `*` stored in `write` or `modify` grants nothing, and a later edit of that list is refused while it keeps it.
- **Flight SQL admits every authenticated caller.** The connection gate used to turn away a caller holding no
  privilege and no provider role; such a caller can now be reached by a `*` grant. Each call is still decided per
  table.
- **Rollback.** A build older than 0.24 reads `*` as an ordinary role name again. Callers who read a table only
  through a `*` grant lose access to it, and a `*` row policy confines nobody, so a caller it confined who reads the
  table another way sees every row. Delete `*` policies, or the read paths they narrow, before rolling back if a
  rollback must not widen reads.

## Row policies on the caller's own rows

A row policy may compare a `string` column with a value of the caller reading the table, `caller.user_hash` or
`caller.project`, and `PUT /v1/tables/{name}/row-policies/{role}` accepts the policy as a SQL condition in `where`
instead of `filter` (see [`row-level-security.md`](row-level-security.md#own-rows-comparing-a-column-with-the-caller)).
Nothing changes for stored policies.

- **`caller.user_hash` needs new settings.** It is derived the way DIAL Core derives its `user.id` log field, from
  `providers.<name>.logging-key`, `.logging-salt` and `.obfuscate-user-email` for an identity provider
  (see [`configuration.md`](configuration.md#identity-providers)), and from `API_KEY_LOGGING_KEY`,
  `API_KEY_LOGGING_SALT` and `API_KEY_OBFUSCATE_USER_EMAIL` for a per-user API key
  (see [`configuration.md`](configuration.md#api-key-authentication)). Set them to the values DIAL Core uses for
  the same provider; leave the API-key settings unset when Core's providers use different salts. The salt is a
  credential: keep it in the deployment's secret store. Without the settings a caller has no user hash, and a
  policy matching on `caller.user_hash` gives that caller no rows.
- **Rollback.** A build older than 0.24 refuses a policy that uses a caller value, so every read that policy
  confines fails. Replace or delete such policies before rolling back.

## Enrichment pipelines calling a DIAL application route

An `llm` transform may now call a DIAL application's custom route instead of chat completions, with
`preset: dial_app_route` and a `route`. Each output may name a `source`, a JSONata expression over the route's
response such as `intent_counts.check`, and otherwise reads the response member of its own name; outputs bound to
nullable columns may be absent from the response (see [`enrichment-registry`](../openspec/specs/enrichment-registry/spec.md)). Request templates
also accept `{{name:json}}`, which inserts a value as JSON instead of an escaped string.

- **Deploy ADAS and the Enrichment Runner together.** The runner contract version moves from `4` to `5`, and a
  runner on the other version is refused until both sides match, so enrichment pauses during the skew.
- **Allow each route first.** A route pipeline can be enabled only when its `(deployment, route)` pair is listed
  in `PUT /v1/settings/app-routes` (see [`instance-settings`](../openspec/specs/instance-settings/spec.md)). The
  setting starts absent, which allows no route. A write that drops a pair an enabled pipeline calls is refused
  with `409 app_route_in_use`.
- **Moving a pipeline off a chat-completions shim.** Allow the pair, disable the pipeline, patch `preset`,
  `route`, `request_template` and each nested output's `source`, then enable it again.
- **Rollback.** Disable every `dial_app_route` pipeline, then roll ADAS and the runner back together. The
  migration that admits the setting name stays applied and is harmless to an older build.

| Change | Effect | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `*` means every authenticated caller in read-side grant lists and row policies; Flight SQL admits every authenticated caller | A `*` stored earlier as a role name opens that table to all callers | Remove unintended `*` entries before upgrading; check the startup log after; before a rollback, delete `*` policies that must keep confining |
| Chart `y_field` is an array (breaking response shape) | Saved-query and dashboard responses return `y_field` as an array; a string is still accepted on write | Move clients that read `y_field` to the array; before a rollback, rewrite stored arrays as above |
| Transform preset `dial_app_route` and the `app-routes` setting; runner contract `5` | A runner on contract `4` is refused | Deploy the matching Enrichment Runner in the same window; allow each route before enabling its pipeline |
| Row policies may use `caller.user_hash` / `caller.project` | `caller.user_hash` matches no row until the `logging-*` settings are set | Set the `logging-*` settings to DIAL Core's values where own-rows policies are used; before a rollback, remove caller-value policies |
