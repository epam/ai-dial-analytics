# ADAS release-0.24 — upgrade notes

What an environment has to do to move from **release-0.23** to **release-0.24**. An environment that has not
applied the previous upgrade notes first follows [`release-0.4-upgrade.md`](release-0.4-upgrade.md).

This release runs ADAS on replicated ClickHouse storage, on every deployment, a single server included
([`clickhouse-replication.md`](clickhouse-replication.md)). That makes it more than a redeploy:

- **ClickHouse Keeper and a `Replicated` database are required.** An `Atomic` database is refused at startup,
  before any change, until an operator changes its engine (§2).
- **Plain tables convert automatically on the first start**, with a deploy that stops the previous version
  first (§3).
- **`CLICKHOUSE_HOST` must reach only the primary replica** (§4).
- **Three new writer grants** (§1).

---

## 1. Before you deploy

- **Keeper.** Embedded in the server on a single node, or a three-member ensemble. Each server also needs
  the `shard` and `replica` macros.
- **Server settings.** In the default profile, `database_replicated_allow_only_replicated_engine = 1`. In
  `<merge_tree>`, `execute_merges_on_single_replica_time_threshold = 1800` and
  `wait_for_unique_parts_send_before_shutdown_ms = 60000`. The reasons are in
  [`clickhouse-replication.md`](clickhouse-replication.md#clickhouse-requirements).
- **Writer grants.**

  ```sql
  GRANT SYSTEM SYNC REPLICA ON <database>.* TO <writer>;
  GRANT SYSTEM SYNC DATABASE REPLICA ON <database>.* TO <writer>;
  GRANT SELECT ON system.clusters TO <writer>;
  ```

  Startup fails naming a missing `SYSTEM SYNC` grant: without them every pipeline run and every ingest cycle
  would be refused with `503`.
  Without `SELECT ON system.clusters` ADAS starts, logs a WARN and routes everything to the primary.
- **NTP** on every ClickHouse node and every ADAS pod: the pipeline safety lag covers clock skew among them.
- **New optional keys.** `CLICKHOUSE_ROUTING_QUERIES`, `CLICKHOUSE_ROUTING_PIPELINES`,
  `CLICKHOUSE_REPLICAS_DISCOVERY_INTERVAL`, `CLICKHOUSE_REPLICAS_SYNC_TIMEOUT` and `CLICKHOUSE_DDL_TASK_TIMEOUT`
  ([`configuration.md`](configuration.md#clickhouse-replicas-and-routing)). The defaults fit most deployments.

## 2. An `Atomic` database

Startup fails before issuing any DDL or writing any catalog row, naming the database and its engine. ADAS
never changes a database engine. Follow
[the manual procedure](clickhouse-replication.md#changing-an-atomic-database-to-replicated), then redeploy.

## 3. A `Replicated` database with plain tables

This is the usual starting point for a deployment managed by ClickHouse's Kubernetes operator: Keeper and a
`Replicated` database already exist, and every ADAS table in it is plain. The first start with this
version converts them in place, before the migrations run. The data moves by hardlink and is not
rewritten.

- **Stop the previous version first.** Use a `Recreate` strategy or scale to zero before deploying. A
  previous-version instance writing during the conversion would lose those rows.
- **With several registered replicas,** make sure only one of them ever held ADAS data, and drop the others
  with `SYSTEM DROP DATABASE REPLICA` or empty their copies. Otherwise the conversion refuses, naming each
  table and replica.
- **While it runs,** readiness is down, `/v1` answers `503` and no scheduled job runs. Liveness keeps
  answering.
- **With `CLICKHOUSE_MIGRATIONS_ENABLED=false`** nothing is converted and startup fails naming each plain
  table.
- **An interrupted conversion** leaves an `_adas_replicate_<table>` table. Every start fails naming it until a
  start with migrations enabled resumes the conversion.

**Rollback.** A release-0.23 build reads and writes the converted tables normally, but its table creates
render plain engines, which `database_replicated_allow_only_replicated_engine = 1` refuses.

## 4. `CLICKHOUSE_HOST`

It now means the primary replica: ingest, API writes and DDL run there. A headless Service over every
ClickHouse pod keeps working while there is one replica. Replace it with an endpoint that reaches only the
primary pod before a second replica joins: startup refuses a host that resolves to several addresses, or
that different replicas answer over fresh connections.
