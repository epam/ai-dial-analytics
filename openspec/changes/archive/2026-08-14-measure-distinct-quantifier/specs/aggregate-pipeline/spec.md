## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Aggregate spec vocabulary

An `aggregate` pipeline's `spec` SHALL declare `group_by`, `measures`, and `freshness` over its input,
plus an optional `filter`. The declaration SHALL be engine-agnostic: it names no ClickHouse function and
no engine construct.

**`group_by`** SHALL be an ordered, non-empty list of key parts, each either:

- a plain declared column of the input, or
- a **time bucket** `{trunc: {col, unit}, as: <name>}` over a declared `date`/`timestamp` column, with
  `unit` from the closed set `{hour, day, week, month}` (week starting Monday/ISO; month starting at
  midnight on the 1st).

**At most one** time bucket SHALL appear in a `group_by`. A `unit` outside the supported set SHALL be
rejected with HTTP 422 stating the supported units. The set is narrower than the truncation function the
query catalog offers: a bucket finer than an hour would carry about as many keys as the rows it
summarizes, and a refresh costs per dirty key. Widening it further is additive.

A `month` bucket SHALL be a **calendar** month, not a fixed number of days, and SHALL be compiled through
the catalog's calendar truncation rather than its fixed-width binning. The pruning bound a bucketed
refresh applies SHALL step by one calendar month accordingly, inside the statement, so the step past the
last dirty bucket stays in the same calendar the bucketing used.

A `month` bucket SHALL be bindable to a `date` or a `timestamp` target column: a month start is midnight
on the 1st, so either temporal type holds it without loss.

**`measures`** SHALL be a non-empty list of `{name, fn, column?, where?, distinct?}` entries. `fn` SHALL
come from the aggregate functions of the shared query function catalog (`count`, `sum`, `avg`, `min`,
`max`, `group_uniq_array`), `column` SHALL be a declared column of the input and SHALL be omitted only for
`count`. A `group_uniq_array` measure SHALL bind only to an `array` target column — it collects the
group's distinct non-null values as a set, sorted so that a recompute of unchanged rows writes the
identical value and the target's collapse stays a no-op — and that column's declared `element_type`
SHALL equal its input column's declared type, whose values the set holds unconverted (see "An array
measure's element type must match its input"). A measure SHALL be **one
function over one column**: no expression is permitted inside a measure. Per-row arithmetic SHALL be a
derived column on the input, and ratios or other expressions *over* measures SHALL be computed at query
time over the stored additive measures — never stored, because a ratio cannot be re-aggregated across
buckets.

A catalog aggregate requiring **more than one argument** SHALL be rejected with HTTP 422 naming the function
and its signature: a measure carries exactly one input column and cannot express such a call. No aggregate
currently in the catalog takes two, so this is a guard on future additions rather than a live restriction —
but it has to be enforced at declaration, because unrejected the declaration would validate, store and
enable, and the arity failure would then be raised inside every scheduled refresh, recorded only in
`state.last_error`. The rule SHALL be keyed on the catalog descriptor's required-argument count rather than
on a list of function names, so an addition is covered without a change here.

**`measures[].distinct`**, when `true`, SHALL deduplicate the values of the measure's input column before
the function is applied, so the measure counts or aggregates the group's *distinct* values rather than its
rows. It SHALL default to `false`, and a declaration that omits it SHALL compile exactly as it does
without the field — the quantifier is additive and changes no stored declaration's meaning.

`distinct` SHALL be accepted only for a function the shared catalog marks `distinct_supported`, and
rejected with HTTP 422 otherwise, naming the function. The acceptability SHALL be read from the catalog
descriptor rather than from a list of function names here, so the pipeline surface and the query surface
cannot disagree about the same function: the query DSL and the SQL front end already accept the quantifier
for `count`, `sum` and `avg` and already refuse it for `group_uniq_array`, whose result is the group's
distinct values already. A rejection for `group_uniq_array` SHALL say so rather than report a generic
unsupported-flag error, matching what the query surface answers.

`distinct: true` SHALL require a `column`. A `count` with no column is a row count, and there is no value
to deduplicate — accepting the pair would store a declaration whose only honest rendering is the
non-distinct one.

`distinct` SHALL compose with `where`: the predicate chooses which of the group's rows the measure reads,
and `distinct` deduplicates the values on those rows. The two are independent, and neither weakens the
one-function-over-one-column rule — `distinct` is a quantifier on the operand, not an expression over it.

`distinct` SHALL introduce no new nullability consequence, and "A nullable measure result requires a
nullable target column" SHALL apply to a distinct measure unchanged: a distinct `count` of nothing is `0`
exactly as a plain `count` of nothing is, and a distinct `sum`/`avg` over a group holding no non-null
value is NULL for the reason the rule already gives — its input column is nullable. The quantifier
deduplicates values that are already there; it cannot make a result NULL that would otherwise not be.

**`measures[].where`**, when present, SHALL be a predicate in the same bounded SQL-boolean grammar as
`filter`, over declared and entitled columns of the input, scoping *that measure* to a subset of its
group's rows. It SHALL be validated at declaration, and its referenced columns SHALL run the same
sensitive-column entitlement check `filter`'s do — a predicate reads its columns even though it derives
nothing from them, and without the check a measure predicate would be a way to test a protected value one
comparison at a time. It SHALL NOT narrow the rows the declaration's other measures read, and SHALL NOT
narrow the dirty-key set a refresh recomputes: a key whose only matching rows fall outside the window must
still be recomputed in full.

A `where` does **not** relax the one-function-over-one-column rule above. It is a row-*membership*
predicate — it chooses which of the group's rows the function reads, and the function still reads one
column of each. That distinction is what makes it additive rather than a loophole: the declarations it
enables have no other expressible form, because `filter` is one predicate over the whole declaration and
narrowing it narrows every measure with it. A whole-chain cost that must sum only the rows starting a
chain is the motivating case.

**A row-membership predicate is not a substitute for `distinct`**, and the two SHALL NOT be conflated: a
`where` selects rows by a property each row carries on its own, so it cannot express "one row per distinct
value of a column" — which row of a group is the representative is a property of the group, not of the
row. Counting the entities in a group whose grain is coarser than its input's row grain is therefore a
`distinct` count and nothing else. Attempting it with a predicate is not merely imprecise but can select
no row at all, silently reporting `0` for a group that holds many entities, when the rows the predicate
would have matched are rows the declaration's `filter` necessarily excludes.

**`filter`**, when present, SHALL be a predicate in the same bounded SQL-boolean grammar the query
façade and enrichment rules use, over declared and entitled columns of the input. It is optional in
general and **required** when a `group_by` key reads a nullable column — see "A nullable group key requires
a declared filter".

**`freshness`** SHALL declare `{mode}`. Only `periodic` is implemented. `incremental` SHALL be rejected
with HTTP 422 naming the deferred capability rather than silently downgraded, so a caller never believes
it has real-time materialization.

**`trigger`** SHALL be `{kind: "schedule", cron: <expression>}`. Any other trigger kind SHALL be
rejected with HTTP 422.

#### Scenario: A measure carrying an expression is rejected

- **WHEN** a `measures` entry supplies an expression instead of a single column
- **THEN** the request is rejected with HTTP 422 pointing at derived columns and query-time expressions

#### Scenario: A measure naming a multi-argument aggregate is rejected

- **WHEN** a `measures` entry names a catalog aggregate whose signature takes two required arguments
- **THEN** the request is rejected with HTTP 422 naming the function, its argument count and its signature,
  and stating that a measure carries exactly one input column

#### Scenario: A distinct count counts entities, not rows

- **GIVEN** an input whose rows are one hop and a group holding 1,200 hops across 40 distinct
  `trace_id` values
- **WHEN** a measure declares `fn: "count"`, `column: "trace_id"` and `distinct: true`
- **THEN** the measure writes `40`

#### Scenario: A distinct quantifier is accepted for a function the catalog marks distinct_supported

- **WHEN** a measure declares `distinct: true` with `fn` of `count`, `sum` or `avg` and a `column`
- **THEN** the declaration is accepted

#### Scenario: A distinct quantifier on a function that does not support it is rejected

- **WHEN** a measure declares `distinct: true` with `fn` of `min` or `max`
- **THEN** the request is rejected with HTTP 422 naming the function, and the decision is taken from the
  catalog descriptor's `distinct_supported` rather than from a list of names in this capability

#### Scenario: A distinct quantifier on an array measure is rejected as redundant

- **WHEN** a measure declares `fn: "group_uniq_array"` with `distinct: true`
- **THEN** the request is rejected with HTTP 422 stating that the function already returns the group's
  distinct values, the same answer the query surface gives for the equivalent `DISTINCT`

#### Scenario: A distinct count with no column is rejected

- **WHEN** a measure declares `fn: "count"` and `distinct: true` but omits `column`
- **THEN** the request is rejected with HTTP 422 stating that a distinct count needs a column to
  deduplicate

#### Scenario: A distinct measure composes with its own predicate

- **GIVEN** a measure declaring `fn: "count"`, `column: "trace_id"`, `distinct: true` and
  `where: "success = true"`
- **WHEN** a refresh compiles the statement
- **THEN** the measure counts the distinct `trace_id` values of the group's rows satisfying the predicate,
  and a group whose rows all fail it writes `0`

#### Scenario: An omitted distinct quantifier changes nothing

- **GIVEN** a pipeline declared before this capability accepted `distinct`
- **WHEN** a refresh compiles its statement
- **THEN** every measure renders exactly as it did before, since an absent `distinct` is `false`

#### Scenario: A measure predicate scopes only its own measure

- **GIVEN** a declaration whose `chain_price` measure declares `where: "parent_deployment IS NULL"` and
  whose `total_tokens` measure declares none
- **WHEN** a refresh compiles the statement
- **THEN** `chain_price` aggregates only the group's rows satisfying the predicate, `total_tokens` aggregates
  every row of the group, and the predicate appears in neither half's `WHERE` clause

#### Scenario: A malformed measure predicate is rejected at declaration

- **WHEN** a `measures[].where` fails the bounded SQL-boolean grammar, or names a column the input does not
  declare
- **THEN** the request is rejected with HTTP 422, rather than stored and left to fail inside every refresh

#### Scenario: A measure predicate over a sensitive column the caller may not read is refused

- **WHEN** a `measures[].where` references a sensitive input column the calling identity is not entitled to
- **THEN** the request is refused with HTTP 403, the same as for a `filter` over that column

#### Scenario: An unsupported bucket unit is rejected

- **WHEN** a `group_by` time bucket declares a `unit` outside `{hour, day, week, month}`
- **THEN** the request is rejected with HTTP 422 stating the supported units

#### Scenario: A month bucket produces calendar months

- **WHEN** a pipeline groups by a `month` time bucket over a timestamp column
- **THEN** each bucket starts at UTC midnight on the first of its month, months of differing lengths each
  form exactly one bucket, and the refresh's pruning bound steps by one calendar month

#### Scenario: A month bucket bound to a date target column is accepted

- **WHEN** a `month` bucket's `as` name is bound to a target column declared `date`
- **THEN** the declaration is accepted, since a month start carries no time-of-day to lose

#### Scenario: Two time buckets are rejected

- **WHEN** a `group_by` declares two `trunc` parts
- **THEN** the request is rejected with HTTP 422

#### Scenario: Incremental freshness is rejected, not downgraded

- **WHEN** a pipeline declares `freshness: {mode: "incremental"}`
- **THEN** the request is rejected with HTTP 422 and no pipeline is stored

#### Scenario: An unknown aggregate function is rejected

- **WHEN** a measure names a function outside the catalog's aggregate group
- **THEN** the request is rejected with HTTP 422
