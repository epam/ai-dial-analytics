## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Supported function catalog

The system SHALL accept in a structured query's expressions only functions from a closed catalog, and
SHALL reject any other function name with HTTP 400. Each catalog entry SHALL define the function's
group (scalar, aggregate, or ordered-set aggregate), arity, operand types, and return type. The
catalog is:

| Function | Group | Arity / signature | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lower` | scalar | `lower(text)` | text |
| `upper` | scalar | `upper(text)` | text |
| `length` | scalar | `length(text)` | integer |
| `trim` | scalar | `trim(text)` | text |
| `abs` | scalar | `abs(numeric)` | numeric |
| `width_bucket` | scalar | `width_bucket(operand, low, high, count)` (4 args) | integer (bucket) |
| `date_bin` | scalar | `date_bin(amount, unit, timestamp)` (3 args) | timestamp (bucket start) |
| `count` | aggregate | `count()` or `count(col)`; `distinct` allowed | long |
| `sum` | aggregate | `sum(numeric)`; `distinct` allowed | numeric |
| `avg` | aggregate | `avg(numeric)`; `distinct` allowed | numeric |
| `min` | aggregate | `min(col)` | col type |
| `max` | aggregate | `max(col)` | col type |
| `percentile_cont` | ordered-set aggregate | `percentile_cont(fraction, column)` | numeric (interpolated) |
| `percentile_disc` | ordered-set aggregate | `percentile_disc(fraction, column)` | type of `column` (an actual member) |

For `percentile_cont`/`percentile_disc`, `fraction` SHALL be a decimal literal in the closed interval
`[0, 1]` and `column` SHALL be any resolvable field expression. The ClickHouse rendering of the
ordered-set aggregates and `width_bucket` is provisional under jOOQ's experimental ClickHouse dialect
and must be verified against a live ClickHouse before being relied upon.

For `date_bin`, `amount` SHALL be a positive integer literal, `unit` SHALL be a string literal from
the closed set {`second`, `minute`, `hour`, `day`, `week`} (case-insensitive), and `timestamp` SHALL
be any resolvable field expression. `date_bin` SHALL truncate the timestamp down to the start of the
fixed-width interval `amount × unit`, aligned to a fixed epoch origin so bucket boundaries fall on
clean `:00`-second marks (e.g. a 5-minute bucket maps `12:03` to `12:00`). It SHALL render to native
ClickHouse `toStartOfInterval(timestamp, INTERVAL amount unit)`; this rendering is deterministic (the
native function name is emitted directly) and is NOT subject to the experimental-dialect caveat above.
Variable-width calendar units (month, quarter, year) SHALL NOT be accepted.

#### Scenario: Catalog function resolves

- **WHEN** a query uses a function listed in the catalog with a matching arity
- **THEN** the function is accepted and translated

#### Scenario: Non-catalog function is rejected

- **WHEN** a query uses a function name absent from the catalog
- **THEN** the query is rejected with HTTP 400

#### Scenario: Out-of-range percentile fraction is rejected

- **WHEN** a query calls `percentile_cont`/`percentile_disc` with a `fraction` outside `[0, 1]`, with
  a non-literal `fraction`, or with other than two arguments
- **THEN** the query is rejected with HTTP 400

#### Scenario: date_bin buckets a timestamp to the interval start

- **WHEN** a query selects `date_bin(5, 'minute', request_time)` aliased and groups by that alias
- **THEN** each row's timestamp is truncated to the start of its 5-minute bucket aligned to the epoch
  origin (a value at `12:03` yields `12:00`), rendering to
  `toStartOfInterval(request_time, INTERVAL 5 MINUTE)`

#### Scenario: date_bin with an invalid unit is rejected

- **WHEN** a query calls `date_bin` with a `unit` outside {`second`,`minute`,`hour`,`day`,`week`}
  (e.g. `month`)
- **THEN** the query is rejected with HTTP 400

#### Scenario: date_bin with wrong arity or non-positive amount is rejected

- **WHEN** a query calls `date_bin` with other than three arguments, a non-integer `amount`, or an
  `amount` that is zero or negative
- **THEN** the query is rejected with HTTP 400
