## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Read and list table definitions

The system SHALL expose `GET /v1/tables/{name}` returning a single definition including its current
`columns` (404 if absent) and `GET /v1/tables` returning all definitions — sources, enrichments, and
aggregations — as a response object (not a bare array). Listing SHALL use a stable order. Each list
item SHALL carry a `column_count` field: the number of exposed columns of that table, equal to the
length of the `columns` array `GET /v1/tables/{name}` returns for the same table (`0` for a
definition with no exposed columns yet); `column_count` SHALL NOT appear on the single-get response.
System columns (reserved `_`-prefix) and the hidden grain key SHALL NOT appear in the exposed
`columns` and SHALL NOT be counted by `column_count`. Each exposed column SHALL carry its optional
user-friendly `display_name` (absent/null when unset), its optional identifying `tag` (absent/null
when unset), its `sensitive` flag (default `false` when unset), its `heavy` flag (default `false`
when unset — see "Heavy column metadata"), and — for an `array`-typed column —
its `element_type` (absent/null for non-array columns). Each returned definition SHALL
carry its `system` flag (default `false` when unset) so operators can see which tables are protected
from modification. The table-management read surface is not column-role-filtered — it returns every
column with its `sensitive` flag so operators can audit and manage sensitivity; role-based hiding of
sensitive columns applies to the query/discovery surface (see
[query-schema-discovery](../query-schema-discovery/spec.md)), not to `/v1/tables`.

#### Scenario: Get a definition with its columns

- **WHEN** `GET /v1/tables/{name}` is called for an existing definition
- **THEN** the response is 200 with the definition's `name`, `description`, `type`, `status`,
  `system` flag, structural fields (`ordering_key`/`partition_by` or
  `source_table`/`grain_key`/`cardinality`), and its exposed `columns`

#### Scenario: Get an unknown definition

- **WHEN** `GET /v1/tables/{name}` is called for a name not in the catalog
- **THEN** the response is 404 with error code `not_found`

#### Scenario: System flag is returned

- **WHEN** `GET /v1/tables/{name}` is called for `dial_usage_log` (a seeded system table) and for a
  user-created table
- **THEN** the seeded table's response carries `system=true` and the user-created table's response
  carries `system=false`

#### Scenario: Array column element type is returned

- **WHEN** a table has a column of `type=array` with `element_type: "string"` (declared via
  `POST /v1/tables/{name}/schema` or via `PATCH add`, or the backfilled
  `dial_usage_log.execution_path`) and `GET /v1/tables/{name}` is called
- **THEN** that column in the response carries `type: "array"` and `element_type: "string"`, while
  non-array columns carry a null/absent `element_type`

#### Scenario: Column display name declared in the schema is returned

- **WHEN** a source's schema (`POST /v1/tables/{name}/schema`) declares a column carrying a
  `display_name` and the table is materialized, then `GET /v1/tables/{name}` is called
- **THEN** that column in the response carries the declared `display_name`, while columns that did not
  declare a display name carry a null `display_name`

#### Scenario: Column tag declared in the schema is returned

- **WHEN** a source's schema (`POST /v1/tables/{name}/schema`) declares a column carrying a `tag`
  and the table is materialized, then `GET /v1/tables/{name}` is called
- **THEN** that column in the response carries the declared `tag`

#### Scenario: Column sensitive flag declared in the schema is returned

- **WHEN** a source's schema (`POST /v1/tables/{name}/schema`) declares a column with
  `sensitive: true` and the table is materialized, then `GET /v1/tables/{name}` is called
- **THEN** that column in the response carries `sensitive: true`, while columns that did not declare
  the flag carry `sensitive: false`

#### Scenario: Column heavy flag declared in the schema is returned

- **WHEN** a source's schema (`POST /v1/tables/{name}/schema`) declares a column with `heavy: true`
  and the table is materialized, then `GET /v1/tables/{name}` is called
- **THEN** that column in the response carries `heavy: true`, while columns that did not declare the
  flag carry `heavy: false`

#### Scenario: List includes all types

- **WHEN** `GET /v1/tables` is called
- **THEN** the response object lists every definition, including enrichment and aggregation
  definitions, in a stable order

#### Scenario: List items carry the exposed-column count

- **WHEN** a source's schema (`POST /v1/tables/{name}/schema`) declares 3 columns and the table
  is materialized, then `GET /v1/tables` is called
- **THEN** that source's list item carries `column_count: 3` and no `columns` array

#### Scenario: Column count is zero for a column-less definition

- **WHEN** an enrichment is created (a grain shell with no exposed columns yet) and `GET /v1/tables`
  is called
- **THEN** that enrichment's list item carries `column_count: 0`

#### Scenario: Column count tracks schema evolution

- **WHEN** a table's schema is patched to add one column and drop one column, then `GET /v1/tables`
  is called
- **THEN** the table's `column_count` equals the length of the `columns` array returned by
  `GET /v1/tables/{name}`

#### Scenario: Column count absent on single-get

- **WHEN** `GET /v1/tables/{name}` is called for an existing definition
- **THEN** the response carries the `columns` array and no `column_count` field

### Requirement: Modify table schema via PATCH

The system SHALL evolve a **materialized** table's schema at `PATCH /v1/tables/{name}/schema` from a
body carrying `add`, `drop`, `rename`, and `update` column operations and an optional `ttl` member.
The endpoint SHALL be allowed only while the table's `status` is `ACTIVE`; on a `PENDING` or
`FAILED` (not-yet-materialized) table it SHALL be rejected with HTTP 409 (its schema is defined and
materialized via `POST /v1/tables/{name}/schema`). The frozen physical keys (`ordering_key`,
`partition_by`, `grain_key`, `cardinality`) are fixed after materialization, and the table's tag
ordering (`tag_order`) is table catalog metadata set via `PUT /v1/tables/{name}`; none of these
SHALL be members of this body — a frozen-key or `tag_order` member SHALL be rejected with HTTP 422
(this rejection precedes the materialization-state check, so it applies regardless of the table's
status). The `ttl` member is the one mutable physical member of this body.

The `ttl` member SHALL follow merge-patch semantics: **absent or null** SHALL leave the table's
TTL unchanged; a **full object** `{column, interval, unit}` SHALL set or replace it (a
`MODIFY TTL` command); an **empty object `{}`** SHALL remove it (a `REMOVE TTL` command). A
partial `ttl` object (some but not all of `column`/`interval`/`unit`) SHALL be rejected with HTTP
422. Removing when no TTL is stored SHALL be an idempotent no-op: HTTP 200 with no `REMOVE TTL`
command emitted. The TTL `column` SHALL be resolved against the table's columns **after** the
request's own `drop`/`rename`/`add` operations are applied, so a just-added or just-renamed column
MAY be referenced; validation follows the "Table TTL" requirement.

All physical commands of one request SHALL be rendered in the canonical order `drop` → `rename` →
`add` → `ttl` and issued as a **single multi-command ClickHouse `ALTER TABLE` statement** (writer
credential), which ClickHouse validates as a whole: the statement is rejected or applied in its
entirety, so a request with one invalid command SHALL leave the physical table completely
unchanged. On success the Postgres catalog (column mapping and TTL) SHALL be updated in one
transaction. The `update` operation SHALL adjust an existing column's catalog-only metadata — its
`tag`, `display_name`, `sensitive` flag, `heavy` flag, and `description` — and SHALL NOT contribute any
ClickHouse `ALTER` command; a request carrying only `update`s (or only an idempotent TTL removal)
SHALL issue no `ALTER` at all. Each `update` entry declares `{name, tag?, display_name?,
sensitive?, heavy?, description?}`, keyed by the column's current exposed name, and SHALL follow
merge-patch semantics per field: a metadata field that is **absent or null** SHALL leave that
column attribute unchanged; a string field (`tag`, `display_name`, `description`) that is
**present and blank** SHALL clear that attribute; a string field that is **present and non-blank**
SHALL set it (trimmed); and `sensitive`/`heavy`, when **present**, SHALL set that flag to the supplied
boolean. A single `update` entry MAY change several metadata fields at once. Each `add` declares
`{source_name, name, type, element_type?, nullable?, description, display_name?, tag?,
sensitive?, heavy?}` (`sensitive` and `heavy` default to false when omitted; `element_type` is
required iff `type=array`, see "Schema validation"), and an added `type=array` column SHALL
materialize as ClickHouse `Array(<element>)`.

An `update` entry MAY target a just-added or just-renamed column by its resulting exposed name. A
column's `display_name`, `tag`, `sensitive` flag, `heavy` flag, and `description` SHALL all be
preserved across a `rename`. Schema modification SHALL be breaking and immediate (a drop or rename takes effect at
once). A ClickHouse `ALTER` failure SHALL leave the table `ACTIVE` (surfaced via the `ErrorView`
contract, status unchanged) and SHALL NOT transition it to `FAILED` — so a materialized table that
holds data is never reachable by the define-and-materialize `POST .../schema` path (which is
`ACTIVE` → 409); because the statement is single and validated as a whole, a failure leaves no
partially-applied operations, and the catalog is written only after the `ALTER` succeeds. In
`oidc` mode this endpoint SHALL be authorized by `FULL_ADMIN` or a matching `modify` access role
on the table. The system SHALL reject: a type-change of an existing column (422); a drop or rename
of a system column (reserved `_`-prefix), the grain key, or an ordering-key column (422); a `drop`
of the column the table's stored TTL references (422 — remove or repoint the TTL in a prior
request first, even if the same request also carries a `ttl` member); an `update` of a column that
is not an exposed column of the table after the request's own add/drop/rename operations are
applied (422); a duplicate `update` of the same column within one request (422); and any operation
on a table not in the catalog (404). A `rename` of the TTL-referenced column SHALL be allowed:
ClickHouse rewrites the physical TTL expression itself, and the catalog's stored TTL column SHALL
be updated to the renamed name in the same transaction. Neither the `update` operation carries a
column mutability restriction — system, grain, and ordering-key columns MAY be tagged, given a
display name, marked sensitive, marked heavy, or described.

#### Scenario: Schema PATCH before materialization is rejected

- **WHEN** `PATCH /v1/tables/{name}/schema` is called on a `PENDING` or `FAILED` table
- **THEN** the request is rejected with HTTP 409 (define and materialize the schema first via
  `POST .../schema`)

#### Scenario: A frozen-key member in a PATCH is rejected

- **WHEN** `PATCH /v1/tables/{name}/schema` carries `ordering_key`, `partition_by`, `grain_key`, or
  `cardinality`
- **THEN** the request is rejected with HTTP 422 (physical keys are frozen after materialization)

#### Scenario: A tag_order member in a PATCH is rejected

- **WHEN** `PATCH /v1/tables/{name}/schema` carries a `tag_order` member
- **THEN** the request is rejected with HTTP 422 (tag ordering is table metadata, set via
  `PUT /v1/tables/{name}`)

#### Scenario: Set a TTL on a materialized table

- **WHEN** `PATCH /v1/tables/{name}/schema` carries
  `ttl: {column: "created_at", interval: 90, unit: "day"}` for an `ACTIVE` table where
  `created_at` is a declared non-nullable `timestamp` column
- **THEN** the issued `ALTER` contains `MODIFY TTL toDateTime(created_at) + INTERVAL 90 DAY`, the
  catalog stores the TTL, and the response carries `ttl: {column: "created_at", interval: 90,
  unit: "day"}`

#### Scenario: Replace an existing TTL

- **WHEN** a `PATCH` carries a full `ttl` object for a table that already has a TTL
- **THEN** a `MODIFY TTL` reflecting the new value is issued and the catalog value is replaced

#### Scenario: Remove a TTL with an empty object

- **WHEN** a `PATCH` carries `ttl: {}` for an `ACTIVE` table that has a TTL
- **THEN** the issued `ALTER` contains `REMOVE TTL`, the catalog value is cleared, and a
  subsequent `GET /v1/tables/{name}` omits the `ttl` member

#### Scenario: Removing an unset TTL is an idempotent no-op

- **WHEN** a `PATCH` carries `ttl: {}` for a table that has no stored TTL (and no other physical
  operations)
- **THEN** the response is 200 and no ClickHouse `ALTER` is issued

#### Scenario: Absent ttl member leaves the TTL unchanged

- **WHEN** a `PATCH` carrying only column operations (no `ttl` member) is applied to a table with
  a TTL
- **THEN** the stored TTL and the physical TTL are unchanged

#### Scenario: Partial ttl object is rejected

- **WHEN** a `PATCH` carries a `ttl` object with some but not all of `column`, `interval`, `unit`
- **THEN** the request is rejected with HTTP 422

#### Scenario: Columns and TTL change in one statement

- **WHEN** a `PATCH` carries an `add` of a non-nullable `timestamp` column `event_time` and
  `ttl: {column: "event_time", interval: 30, unit: "day"}`
- **THEN** a single `ALTER` statement carrying both the `ADD COLUMN` and the `MODIFY TTL`
  commands is issued, and the TTL references the just-added column

#### Scenario: One invalid command leaves the whole PATCH unapplied

- **WHEN** a `PATCH` carries a valid `add` and an invalid `ttl` (or any command ClickHouse
  rejects), so the single `ALTER` statement fails
- **THEN** the response is an `ErrorView` error, no command of the statement is applied (the
  column is not added), the table stays `ACTIVE`, and the catalog is unchanged

#### Scenario: Drop of the TTL-referenced column is rejected

- **WHEN** a `PATCH` carries a `drop` of the column the table's stored TTL references
- **THEN** the request is rejected with HTTP 422 (remove or repoint the TTL first), regardless of
  any `ttl` member in the same request

#### Scenario: Rename of the TTL-referenced column keeps catalog and table in sync

- **WHEN** a `PATCH` renames the column the table's stored TTL references
- **THEN** the rename is applied (ClickHouse rewrites the TTL expression), and the catalog's
  stored TTL column reflects the new name, so `GET /v1/tables/{name}` returns the renamed column
  in its `ttl` object

#### Scenario: A failed live ALTER leaves the table ACTIVE

- **WHEN** a `PATCH /v1/tables/{name}/schema` request's single ClickHouse `ALTER` fails on an
  `ACTIVE` table that holds data
- **THEN** the response is an `ErrorView` error, the table's `status` remains `ACTIVE` (it does not
  become `FAILED`), and `POST /v1/tables/{name}/schema` continues to reject it with HTTP 409

#### Scenario: Add columns to a materialized enrichment

- **WHEN** `PATCH /v1/tables/{name}/schema` adds valid columns to an `ACTIVE` enrichment
- **THEN** an `ALTER` statement with an `ADD COLUMN` command per column is issued, the column
  mapping is updated, and the response reflects the new columns

#### Scenario: Add an array column

- **WHEN** `PATCH /v1/tables/{name}/schema` adds a column of `type:"array"`, `element_type:"long"`
  to an `ACTIVE` table
- **THEN** an `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ... Array(Int64)` is issued and the column mapping records
  the `array` type with element type `long`

#### Scenario: Drop and rename apply immediately

- **WHEN** `PATCH /v1/tables/{name}/schema` drops one column and renames another on an `ACTIVE` table
- **THEN** a single `ALTER` statement carrying the `DROP COLUMN` and `RENAME COLUMN` commands is
  issued and the column mapping is updated

#### Scenario: Type change is rejected

- **WHEN** a `PATCH` attempts to change the `type` of an existing column
- **THEN** the request is rejected with HTTP 422

#### Scenario: System and grain columns are protected

- **WHEN** a `PATCH` attempts to drop or rename a `_`-prefixed system column or an enrichment's grain
  key
- **THEN** the request is rejected with HTTP 422

#### Scenario: Update changes several metadata fields at once

- **WHEN** a single `update` entry supplies a `tag`, a `display_name`, and `sensitive: true` for an
  existing column
- **THEN** all three attributes are set on that column and no ClickHouse `ALTER` is issued

#### Scenario: Absent metadata field leaves an attribute unchanged

- **WHEN** an `update` entry supplies only a `tag` for a column that already has a `display_name`
- **THEN** the column's `tag` is set and its existing `display_name`, `sensitive` flag, `heavy` flag,
  and `description` are unchanged

#### Scenario: Update toggles the heavy flag without an ALTER

- **WHEN** an `update` entry supplies `heavy: true` for an existing column, and a later request
  supplies `heavy: false` for the same column
- **THEN** the flag is set and then cleared, no ClickHouse `ALTER` is issued by either request, and
  wildcard projections on the query surface follow the current value

#### Scenario: Blank metadata field clears an attribute

- **WHEN** an `update` entry supplies a blank (`""`) `tag`, `display_name`, or `description` for a
  column that currently has that attribute set
- **THEN** that attribute is cleared, and no ClickHouse `ALTER` is issued

#### Scenario: Metadata survives a rename

- **WHEN** a `PATCH` `update`s an existing column's `tag`, `display_name`, `sensitive` flag, `heavy`
  flag, and `description`, then a later `PATCH` renames that column
- **THEN** all five attributes are preserved under the rename, none of which issues a ClickHouse
  `ALTER`

#### Scenario: Update of an unknown column is rejected

- **WHEN** an `update` entry names a column that is not an exposed column of the table (after the
  request's own add/drop/rename operations are applied)
- **THEN** the request is rejected with HTTP 422

#### Scenario: Duplicate update of the same column is rejected

- **WHEN** two `update` entries in one request name the same column
- **THEN** the request is rejected with HTTP 422

#### Scenario: A modify access role authorizes a non-admin schema change

- **WHEN** a non-`FULL_ADMIN` caller holding a matching `modify` access role on an `ACTIVE` table
  `PATCH`es its schema
- **THEN** the modification is authorized and processed

### Requirement: Define and materialize a table schema

The system SHALL expose `POST /v1/tables/{name}/schema` to define the complete physical schema of a
not-yet-materialized table AND materialize it (issue `CREATE TABLE`, flip to `ACTIVE`) in a single
call. The endpoint SHALL be allowed only while the table's `status` is `PENDING` or `FAILED`; on an
already `ACTIVE` (materialized) table it SHALL be rejected with HTTP 409 (a materialized schema evolves
through `PATCH /v1/tables/{name}/schema`).

The request body SHALL carry the table's physical schema: `columns` (the exposed columns, each
`{source_name, name, type, element_type?, nullable?, description?, display_name?, tag?, sensitive?,
heavy?}`)
plus the physical keys for the table's kind — `ordering_key` and optional `partition_by` for a
`source`; `grain_key` and optional `cardinality` for an `enrichment` — and an optional `ttl`
declaration `{column, interval, unit}` (see "Table TTL" for its validation and rendering rules).
The `name`, `type`, and `source_table` (identity/relationship) SHALL NOT appear in this body (they
are set and fixed by `POST /v1/tables`).

The system SHALL validate the schema — both completeness for the table's kind and internal consistency
(see "Schema validation") — before persisting anything or issuing any ClickHouse DDL: a `source` SHALL
have at least one column and a non-empty `ordering_key` whose columns (and `partition_by` column, if
any) are present; an `enrichment` SHALL have a `grain_key` that is a declared column of its
`source_table` and MAY have zero user columns; a `ttl`, when present, SHALL satisfy the "Table TTL"
constraints (declared non-nullable `date`/`timestamp` column, positive `interval`, valid `unit`). An
incomplete or inconsistent schema SHALL be rejected with HTTP 422, leaving the definition untouched
(still `PENDING`/`FAILED`, nothing persisted).

On a valid schema the system SHALL persist the columns + keys (and the `ttl`, when declared) and
issue a single ClickHouse `CREATE TABLE` (writer credential) — a `source` as `MergeTree ORDER BY
(ordering_key)` (with `PARTITION BY` when `partition_by` is set), an `enrichment` as
`ReplacingMergeTree(_updated_at)` with `ORDER BY (grain_key)` carrying its grain-key and system
columns, the version column rendered as `_updated_at DateTime64(3) DEFAULT now64(3)` so that every
write lands with a strictly increasing RMT version and duplicate writes for the same grain collapse
to the latest on a `final=1` read — with a `TTL` clause appended when a `ttl` is declared — and flip
the definition to `status=ACTIVE`, returning the materialized definition. A `type=array` column SHALL
materialize as ClickHouse `Array(<element>)`. If the `CREATE TABLE` fails or its outcome is ambiguous
(e.g. a timeout under which ClickHouse may still create the table), the system SHALL issue a
best-effort `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS`, set the definition to `status=FAILED`, and return an error using
the `ErrorView` contract without leaking ClickHouse internals; a `FAILED` table MAY be re-posted
(with its full schema) to retry. In `oidc` mode the endpoint SHALL be authorized by `FULL_ADMIN` or a
matching `modify` access role, and a `system`-owned table SHALL reject it with HTTP 409 regardless of
role.

#### Scenario: Define and materialize a source

- **WHEN** `POST /v1/tables/{name}/schema` is called on a `PENDING` source with `columns` and a
  non-empty `ordering_key` referencing declared columns
- **THEN** a single `CREATE TABLE ... ENGINE = MergeTree ORDER BY (...)` is issued, the definition
  becomes `status=ACTIVE`, and the response reflects the materialized schema

#### Scenario: Define a source with partitioning

- **WHEN** the request includes a `partition_by` naming a declared column and a time granularity
- **THEN** the rendered `CREATE TABLE` includes a matching `PARTITION BY` expression

#### Scenario: Define a source with a TTL

- **WHEN** `POST /v1/tables/{name}/schema` is called on a `PENDING` source with a valid `ttl`
  declaration `{column: "event_date", interval: 6, unit: "month"}` where `event_date` is a declared
  non-nullable `date` column
- **THEN** the rendered `CREATE TABLE` ends with `TTL event_date + INTERVAL 6 MONTH`, the catalog
  stores the TTL, and the materialized definition carries the `ttl` object

#### Scenario: Invalid TTL declaration keeps the table un-materialized

- **WHEN** `POST /v1/tables/{name}/schema` carries a `ttl` whose column is not declared, is
  nullable, or is not a `date`/`timestamp` column
- **THEN** the request is rejected with HTTP 422, no ClickHouse DDL is issued, and the definition
  remains `PENDING`/`FAILED`

#### Scenario: Define a source with an array column

- **WHEN** the request includes a column of `type=array` with `element_type: "string"`
- **THEN** the rendered `CREATE TABLE` declares that column as `Array(String)`

#### Scenario: Define and materialize an enrichment

- **WHEN** `POST /v1/tables/{name}/schema` is called on a `PENDING` enrichment with a `grain_key` that
  is a declared column of its `source_table` (and zero or more user `columns`)
- **THEN** a single `CREATE TABLE ... ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree(_updated_at) ORDER BY (grain_key)`
  is issued carrying its grain-key and system columns plus any user columns, and the definition
  becomes `status=ACTIVE`

#### Scenario: Enrichment version column carries a default

- **WHEN** an enrichment table is materialized
- **THEN** its `_updated_at` column is rendered `DateTime64(3) DEFAULT now64(3)`, so a write that
  omits `_updated_at` still receives an increasing version stamped by ClickHouse

#### Scenario: Incomplete schema is rejected and stays pending

- **WHEN** `POST /v1/tables/{name}/schema` is called on a source with no columns or an empty
  `ordering_key`, or on an enrichment with no `grain_key`
- **THEN** the request is rejected with HTTP 422, no ClickHouse `CREATE TABLE` is issued, and the
  definition remains `status=PENDING`

#### Scenario: Inconsistent schema is rejected

- **WHEN** `POST /v1/tables/{name}/schema` declares an `ordering_key` column not present in `columns`,
  or an enrichment `grain_key` that is not a column of its `source_table`
- **THEN** the request is rejected with HTTP 422 and nothing is persisted

#### Scenario: Define on a materialized table is rejected

- **WHEN** `POST /v1/tables/{name}/schema` is called on an `ACTIVE` table
- **THEN** the request is rejected with HTTP 409 (use `PATCH` to evolve a live table)

#### Scenario: ClickHouse failure marks the table FAILED

- **WHEN** the ClickHouse `CREATE TABLE` fails during the define-and-materialize call
- **THEN** the system issues a best-effort `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS`, sets the definition to
  `status=FAILED`, and the response is an error using the `ErrorView` contract with no raw ClickHouse
  internals


## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Heavy column metadata

Each exposed column SHALL carry a boolean `heavy` flag, default `false`, marking the column as
expensive to transfer (a large payload/blob column). Like `tag`, `display_name`, and `sensitive`, it
SHALL be **catalog-only metadata**: it SHALL NOT appear in any ClickHouse DDL, SHALL NOT be validated
against the physical column type, and changing it SHALL move no data and issue no `ALTER`.

The flag SHALL be declarable wherever column metadata is declared — a `columns` entry of
`POST /v1/tables/{name}/schema` and an `add` entry of `PATCH /v1/tables/{name}/schema` (defaulting to
`false` when omitted) — and changeable on a materialized table through the `PATCH` `update`
merge-patch. It SHALL be returned in the column payloads of `GET /v1/tables/{name}` unfiltered by
role, and preserved across a `rename`. The flag SHALL be settable on any
exposed column, including a system, grain, or ordering-key column.

`heavy` SHALL be a **cost hint, not an access control**: it SHALL NOT hide the column from any
caller and SHALL NOT restrict any clause. Its only effect is on the query surfaces' wildcard
projection (see the `structured-query` and `sql-query-translation` capabilities): a heavy column is
omitted from a wildcard expansion and returned normally when named explicitly. Confidentiality stays
governed exclusively by `sensitive`.

#### Scenario: Heavy declared at schema definition

- **WHEN** a `POST /v1/tables/{name}/schema` body declares one column with `heavy: true` and the
  others without the member
- **THEN** the table materializes with no reference to heaviness in the issued `CREATE TABLE`, and
  the catalog records `heavy: true` for that column and `false` for the rest

#### Scenario: Heavy toggled on a materialized table

- **WHEN** `PATCH /v1/tables/{name}/schema` sends `{"update": [{"name": "payload", "heavy": true}]}`
  on an `ACTIVE` table
- **THEN** the response is 200, no ClickHouse `ALTER` is issued, and `GET /v1/tables/{name}` reports
  that column with `heavy: true`

#### Scenario: Heavy is settable on a protected column

- **WHEN** an `update` entry marks an ordering-key column or a `_`-prefixed system column `heavy: true`
- **THEN** the request succeeds — the column-mutability restrictions apply to `drop`/`rename`, not to
  metadata

#### Scenario: Heavy does not restrict visibility

- **WHEN** a column is marked `heavy: true` and `sensitive: false`, and a `READ_ONLY_ADMIN` caller
  reads the query schema and then queries that column by name
- **THEN** the column is present in the discovered schema and the query returns its values — the flag
  changes only what a wildcard expands to

### Requirement: Seeded heavy columns on the built-in source tables

The catalog migrations SHALL seed the `heavy` flag on the built-in source tables' raw-payload columns
so that a wildcard projection over the seeded schema is cheap by default. The seeded heavy set SHALL
be `dial_usage_log.request_body` and `dial_usage_log.response_body` — the verbatim LLM request and
response bodies, the only seeded columns whose per-row size is unbounded. Every other seeded column
SHALL default to `heavy = false`, including the `object`-typed `jwt_claims` and `request_tags` (small
claim/header documents) and `rate_analytics.comment` (a short free-text note).

Both seeded heavy columns are also seeded `sensitive` (see "Seeded column sensitivity on the built-in
source tables"), so for a caller who is not `FULL_ADMIN` they are already absent from the model and
the heavy flag changes nothing; the wildcard behavior change is observable only to `FULL_ADMIN`
callers and when `security.mode=none`.

#### Scenario: Seeded heavy flags after migration

- **WHEN** the catalog is read after the table-catalog migrations run
- **THEN** `dial_usage_log` reports `request_body` and `response_body` with `heavy: true`, and every
  other column of `dial_usage_log` and `rate_analytics` with `heavy: false`

#### Scenario: Management responses expose the seeded heavy flag

- **WHEN** a `FULL_ADMIN` caller reads `GET /v1/tables/dial_usage_log`
- **THEN** the response lists `response_body` with `heavy: true` alongside its `sensitive: true`, so
  an operator can audit which columns a wildcard omits
